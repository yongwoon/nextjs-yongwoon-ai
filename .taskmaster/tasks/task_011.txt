# Task ID: 11
# Title: Redis Caching System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Redis-based caching for prompts and responses
# Details:
Install redis@^4.6 and @types/redis. Create Redis client with connection pooling. Implement prompt caching with hash-based keys using crypto.createHash('sha256'). Add response caching with TTL (1 hour for similar prompts). Create cache invalidation strategies. Implement cache warming for popular prompts. Add cache hit/miss metrics. Use Redis Streams for real-time features if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test cache hit/miss rates, TTL expiration, invalidation strategies, and performance improvements
