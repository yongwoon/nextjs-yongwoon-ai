# Task ID: 5
# Title: Cross-Browser Security System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement browser fingerprinting and verification code system for cross-browser access
# Details:
Install @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs@^4.2 for browser fingerprinting. Create browser detection service using navigator.userAgent, screen resolution, timezone. Implement 6-digit verification code generation and storage in verification_codes table. Create CrossBrowserVerificationPage and VerificationPage components. Add IP tracking using headers['x-forwarded-for']. Implement session tracking in auth_sessions table with browser_fingerprint field.

# Test Strategy:
Test cross-browser detection, verification code generation/validation, session tracking, and security logging

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and configure FingerprintJS library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the FingerprintJS library to enable browser fingerprinting capabilities in the application
### Details:
Install @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs@^4.2 using npm or yarn. Create a fingerprint service that initializes the FingerprintJS agent and provides methods to get visitor identification. Implement a wrapper function that returns a promise resolving to a unique browser fingerprint. Ensure the fingerprint is cached appropriately to avoid unnecessary recalculations.

## 2. Create browser detection service [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement a service that collects and analyzes browser environment data for identification purposes
### Details:
Create a BrowserDetectionService that extracts and normalizes data from navigator.userAgent, screen resolution, timezone, and other browser-specific attributes. Implement methods to detect browser type, version, operating system, and device type. Create a function that generates a composite identifier based on these attributes. Add functionality to detect potential spoofing or privacy tools that might interfere with accurate detection.

## 3. Implement verification code system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a system for generating, storing, and validating 6-digit verification codes for cross-browser authentication
### Details:
Implement a function to generate secure random 6-digit codes. Create database schema for verification_codes table with fields for code, user_id, browser_fingerprint, ip_address, created_at, expires_at, and used status. Develop an API endpoint to generate and store new codes. Implement code validation logic with expiration checking and one-time use enforcement. Add IP tracking using the x-forwarded-for header and store it with each verification code.

## 4. Develop verification UI components [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create React components for the verification flow in cross-browser scenarios
### Details:
Implement CrossBrowserVerificationPage component that detects new browsers and triggers the verification flow. Create VerificationPage component with a form for entering the 6-digit code. Add validation feedback and error handling for incorrect or expired codes. Implement a resend code feature with appropriate rate limiting. Design responsive UI that works well on mobile and desktop browsers.

## 5. Implement session tracking with browser fingerprints [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Enhance the authentication system to track and verify sessions across different browsers
### Details:
Modify the auth_sessions table to include browser_fingerprint field. Update the authentication service to store fingerprint data with each new session. Implement logic to detect and handle session changes across different browsers. Create an admin dashboard component to view active sessions with browser details. Add functionality for users to view and manage their active sessions across different browsers.
