# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement authentication attempt logging and anomaly detection
# Details:
Create logging service for auth_attempt_logs table capturing: IP, user_agent, attempt_type, success/failure, timestamp. Implement rate limiting using Redis with sliding window algorithm. Add suspicious activity detection: multiple failed attempts, unusual IP patterns, rapid successive logins. Create security dashboard component for admin users. Implement email alerts for security events using Supabase Edge Functions.

# Test Strategy:
Test logging accuracy, rate limiting effectiveness, anomaly detection triggers, and alert system functionality
