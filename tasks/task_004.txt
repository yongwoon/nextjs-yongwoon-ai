# Task ID: 4
# Title: AI Model Integration Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a unified framework for integrating multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI) with automatic switching, load balancing, and optimized prompt handling.
# Details:
1. Install required dependencies:
   - @vercel/ai@latest
   - openai@4.x
   - @anthropic-ai/sdk@latest
   - @google/generative-ai@latest
2. Create a unified AI provider interface:
   - Abstract model selection
   - Standardized prompt formatting
   - Response parsing
   - Error handling
3. Implement model-specific adapters for:
   - OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo)
   - Anthropic (Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet)
   - Google AI (Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra)
4. Add automatic model fallback and load balancing:
   - Health checks for each provider
   - Automatic switching on failure
   - Cost-based routing
5. Implement prompt optimization for each model:
   - Model-specific system prompts
   - Context window management
   - Token counting and optimization
6. Create a configuration system for model preferences and API keys
7. Implement streaming response handling for all models

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each model adapter individually
2. Verify automatic fallback when primary model fails
3. Test load balancing with simulated traffic
4. Validate prompt optimization for different models
5. Measure response times and compare
6. Test streaming responses from each provider
7. Verify error handling and recovery
8. Validate token counting accuracy
