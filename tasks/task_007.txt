# Task ID: 7
# Title: Server-Sent Events Streaming Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a robust Server-Sent Events (SSE) system for real-time AI response streaming with user interaction capabilities during streaming.
# Details:
1. Create SSE infrastructure:
   - Implement SSE endpoint using Next.js Route Handlers
   - Configure proper headers and connection handling
   - Add heartbeat mechanism to keep connections alive
2. Implement AI response streaming:
   - Connect to AI providers' streaming APIs
   - Transform AI chunks to SSE format
   - Handle backpressure and flow control
3. Add client-side SSE handling:
   - Create custom React hooks for SSE connections
   - Implement progressive rendering of responses
   - Handle connection errors and retries
4. Implement user interaction during streaming:
   - Stop generation button
   - Follow-up question preparation
   - Response feedback mechanisms
5. Add advanced streaming features:
   - Pause/resume functionality
   - Stream branching for alternative responses
   - Partial response saving
6. Implement connection management:
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Graceful degradation to polling
   - Connection status indicators

# Test Strategy:
1. Test streaming performance with various response lengths
2. Verify connection stability over time
3. Test interruption and continuation functionality
4. Validate behavior on network fluctuations
5. Test concurrent streaming connections
6. Verify memory usage during long streaming sessions
7. Test reconnection logic after disconnection
8. Validate user interaction during streaming
