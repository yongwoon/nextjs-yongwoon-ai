# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Docker Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js 15 project with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Set up Docker development environment with necessary configurations.
# Details:
1. Create a new Next.js 15 project with App Router: `npx create-next-app@latest yongwoon-ai --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app`
2. Configure TypeScript (tsconfig.json) with strict mode enabled
3. Set up Docker development environment with:
   - Node.js 18+ base image (node:18-alpine)
   - Multi-stage build for development and production
   - Docker Compose for local development with Redis and other services
   - Volume mapping for hot reloading
4. Configure environment variables (.env.local, .env.example)
5. Set up project structure following Next.js 15 best practices:
   - app/ (for App Router)
   - components/ (for UI components)
   - lib/ (for utilities)
   - types/ (for TypeScript types)
   - public/ (for static assets)
6. Install core dependencies:
   - next@15.x
   - react@19.x
   - react-dom@19.x
   - tailwindcss@3.x
   - typescript@5.x
   - @vercel/ai@latest

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker container builds successfully
2. Ensure Next.js development server runs in Docker environment
3. Validate hot reloading functionality
4. Check TypeScript configuration with sample components
5. Verify Tailwind CSS is working correctly
6. Test environment variable loading
