# Status: pending

# Priority: high
# Description: Setup Supabase client with TypeScript types and authentication configuration
# Details:
Install @supabase/supabase-js@^2.38. Generate TypeScript types using `supabase gen types typescript`. Create lib/supabase.ts with createClient configuration for both client and server components. Setup middleware.ts for auth state management. Configure Supabase Auth settings: disable email confirmation, enable magic links, set custom SMTP if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Supabase client connects successfully, types are generated correctly, and auth state persists across page refreshes
