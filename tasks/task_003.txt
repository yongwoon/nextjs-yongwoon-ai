# Task ID: 3
# Title: Authentication System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a complete authentication system using Supabase Auth with user registration, login, password reset, and session management.
# Details:
1. Create authentication UI components:
   - SignUp form
   - Login form
   - Password reset form
   - Email verification
   - Profile management
2. Implement authentication API routes using Next.js App Router:
   - app/api/auth/[...supabase]/route.ts for handling auth callbacks
3. Set up middleware for protected routes in middleware.ts
4. Create auth context provider for React components:
   - User state management
   - Loading states
   - Auth methods (login, logout, signup)
5. Implement server-side session validation
6. Add role-based access control (RBAC) for user/admin separation
7. Set up email templates for verification and password reset
8. Implement remember me functionality with extended session duration
9. Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) for social login

# Test Strategy:
1. Test complete user registration flow
2. Verify login with valid and invalid credentials
3. Test password reset functionality
4. Validate session persistence and expiration
5. Test protected route access with and without authentication
6. Verify role-based access control
7. Test OAuth authentication flows
8. Validate error handling and user feedback
