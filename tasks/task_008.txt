# Task ID: 8
# Title: Document Upload and Processing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system for uploading, parsing, and processing various document types (PDF, Word, text) for the RAG system.
# Details:
1. Implement file upload functionality:
   - Create drag-and-drop interface
   - Set up Vercel Blob Storage integration
   - Add file type validation and size limits
2. Implement document parsing:
   - Install dependencies: `npm install pdf-parse mammoth`
   - PDF parsing with pdf-parse
   - Word document parsing with mammoth
   - Plain text and markdown handling
3. Create document processing pipeline:
   - File upload to temporary storage
   - Document parsing and text extraction
   - Metadata extraction (title, author, date)
   - Chunking text into manageable segments
   - Storing processed documents in Supabase
4. Add document management UI:
   - Document list view
   - Document details page
   - Processing status indicators
   - Delete/archive functionality
5. Implement background processing:
   - Queue system for large documents
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Error handling and retry logic
6. Add support for additional file types:
   - CSV/Excel with xlsx package
   - HTML parsing
   - Code files with syntax awareness

# Test Strategy:
1. Test upload functionality with various file types and sizes
2. Verify parsing accuracy for different document formats
3. Test chunking algorithm with various content types
4. Validate metadata extraction
5. Test concurrent uploads and processing
6. Verify error handling for corrupt files
7. Test large document processing performance
8. Validate document management UI functionality
