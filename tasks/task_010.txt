# Task ID: 10
# Title: RAG System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines document knowledge with AI capabilities for accurate, context-aware responses.
# Details:
1. Install LangChain dependencies: `npm install langchain @langchain/openai`
2. Implement RAG pipeline components:
   - Document retriever using vector database
   - Context builder with relevance filtering
   - Prompt construction with retrieved context
   - Response generation with AI models
3. Create advanced retrieval strategies:
   - Multi-query retrieval for complex questions
   - Hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword)
   - Re-ranking of retrieved documents
4. Implement context management:
   - Dynamic context window sizing
   - Token budget management
   - Context prioritization algorithms
5. Add RAG-specific prompting techniques:
   - Few-shot examples for better grounding
   - Source attribution instructions
   - Confidence scoring
6. Create evaluation and feedback loop:
   - Answer quality assessment
   - Retrieval precision metrics
   - User feedback collection
7. Implement advanced RAG features:
   - Multi-step reasoning
   - Query decomposition for complex questions
   - Self-correction mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
1. Test RAG accuracy with known-answer questions
2. Evaluate retrieval precision and recall
3. Test with various document types and content
4. Benchmark end-to-end response time
5. Validate source attribution accuracy
6. Test with complex, multi-part questions
7. Evaluate context relevance
8. Test with edge cases (no relevant context, ambiguous questions)

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Retrieval System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the retrieval component using a vector database and embedding models to efficiently fetch relevant documents from the knowledge base.
### Details:
Include dense retrieval techniques, indexing strategies, and support for both keyword and semantic search. Define accuracy metrics such as retrieval precision, recall, and latency. Test scenarios: simple fact lookup, ambiguous queries, and retrieval under high load.

## 2. Context Building and Relevance Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms to build query context and filter retrieved documents for relevance before passing them to the generation model.
### Details:
Implement context windowing, reranking, and relevance scoring. Use metrics like context relevance score and context window hit rate. Test scenarios: multi-part queries, context drift, and irrelevant document filtering.

## 3. Dynamic Prompt Construction [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create dynamic prompts for the language model by integrating filtered context and user queries, optimizing for clarity and completeness.
### Details:
Engineer prompts to maximize model performance and minimize hallucinations. Metrics: prompt completeness, prompt clarity, and prompt-induced error rate. Test scenarios: prompt length limits, ambiguous context, and prompt injection attempts.

## 4. Response Generation with Source Attribution [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Generate coherent responses using the language model, ensuring each answer includes accurate source attribution for transparency.
### Details:
Integrate mechanisms for inline citation and source linking. Metrics: attribution accuracy, response fluency, and citation coverage. Test scenarios: multi-source answers, missing sources, and conflicting source information.

## 5. Multi-Step Reasoning for Complex Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Implement multi-step reasoning and query decomposition to handle complex or multi-part user queries, coordinating across retrieval and generation agents.
### Details:
Enable agent orchestration for subtask division and iterative reasoning. Metrics: reasoning accuracy, decomposition success rate, and stepwise consistency. Test scenarios: multi-hop questions, chained reasoning, and self-correction.

## 6. Evaluation and Feedback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Establish evaluation pipelines and feedback loops to monitor system performance, collect user feedback, and iteratively improve accuracy.
### Details:
Implement automated and human-in-the-loop evaluation, user feedback collection, and continuous retraining. Metrics: end-to-end accuracy, user satisfaction, and error reduction rate. Test scenarios: regression testing, adversarial queries, and feedback-driven improvement.
