# Task ID: 14
# Title: Performance Optimization and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimization techniques and monitoring systems to ensure the platform runs efficiently at scale.
# Details:
1. Set up performance monitoring:
   - Install and configure Sentry for error tracking
   - Implement custom performance metrics
   - Create logging infrastructure
2. Optimize frontend performance:
   - Implement React Server Components strategically
   - Add code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize image loading with Next.js Image
   - Implement client-side caching
3. Enhance backend performance:
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement query caching
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Optimize API routes with edge functions
4. Improve AI response performance:
   - Implement tiered caching strategy
   - Optimize prompt construction
   - Add parallel processing where applicable
5. Create performance dashboards:
   - Real-time metrics visualization
   - Historical performance data
   - Alerting for performance degradation
6. Implement load testing:
   - Create load testing scripts
   - Establish performance baselines
   - Identify and address bottlenecks

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark page load times before and after optimization
2. Test API response times under various loads
3. Measure memory usage patterns
4. Validate error tracking functionality
5. Test performance with simulated traffic
6. Verify monitoring dashboard accuracy
7. Test alerting functionality
8. Validate optimization improvements with metrics
