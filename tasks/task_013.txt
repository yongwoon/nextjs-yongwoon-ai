# Task ID: 13
# Title: Document Parsing and Text Extraction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement automatic text extraction and document chunking for RAG
# Details:
Create document processing service with text extraction for PDF (pdf-parse), Word (mammoth), and plain text. Implement intelligent chunking using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with overlap. Add chunk size optimization (500-1000 tokens). Create document preprocessing: cleaning, normalization, metadata extraction. Store chunks in document_chunks table with vector embeddings. Implement async processing using Supabase Edge Functions.

# Test Strategy:
Test text extraction accuracy, chunking quality, processing speed, and chunk storage for various document types
